# project-two_number-guessing-game 
The second weekly project completed during my Full Stack Web Development program at BrainStation. PLEASE NOTE: The state of this code is untouched from when I created it during the bootcamp. The technologies used for this project were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery and an external JavaScript file for the fireworks.
